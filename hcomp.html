                    <h1>Prototyping Human-AI Interactions</h1>
                    Designing Human-AI (HAI) interactions remains a challenging task. AI models are both complex and uncertain, providing a particular design 
					challenge [1]. There are also challenges that arise during the collaboration between engineers and designers, as abstractions leak and 
					concepts need to be re-negotiated [2]. At the same time, the design space is expanding. As well as human-centered AI methods such as 
					Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) and explainable AI (XAI), new interaction paradigms can extend the design space of HAI interactions by, for instance,
					enabling users to interact with models in teaching-learning and collaborative learning processes [3,4], or negotiation-based interactions [5].
					Part of the issue is a lack of consistent language to describe interactions between humans and models. There is considerable work on low level
					descriptions, including frameworks and tools which focus on the dataflow representations of  pre-processing ML pipelines [6] or the processes 
					and data structures used in hybrid (data-driven and knowledge-based) AI systems [7]. However, we lack systems that formally model the ways 
					that humans interact with these systems, and in particular ways to think about the multiple actors that might interact with a real-world 
					machine learning system once it is deployed. In order to address this, we have developed a model that builds on communicative acts to provide 
					a specification for interactions between (multiple) human users and models, drawing on considerations from human-centred AI approaches,
					including explainability and interactivity. It allows for modelling the flows of data between human actors and ML systems as communicative 
					exchanges that can be understood in natural language terms but also provide a semi-formal specification for the underlying protocol. This is 
					aimed at making the design of ML systems open to a wider set of potential creators by providing a simple articulation of system properties 
					that can be rapidly understood, but remains technologically grounded. Designing in this way supports creative ideation around the emerging 
					computational possibilities of machine learning, providing clear objects for discussion as well as ways to share common interactional 
					structures.

				This half day tutorial workshop aims to bring together designers, engineers, and practitioners to explore this new method for prototyping interactions between 
users and AI models. Through a combination of paper and screen based tools, we will take participants through this approach to designing Human-AI interactions. 
We will show how this approach can describe a range of common interaction paradigms such as XAI and HITL, and guide participants in creating their own representations.
Participants will follow structured paper-and-card based design exercises that articulate the core concepts through worked examples, and then adapt these to their
own case studies. They will also use a screen-based tool that supports model-informed prototyping [8], to work towards higher fidelity understandings of 
interactions with models. Finally, we will support them in relating the choice of interactional structure to high level guidelines for HAI design. The main 
outcome of the workshop will be the interactions with the participants and the development of understanding of how to model HAI interactions. We will produce 
a set of example HAI interaction designs based on participant’s case studies that can be brought together as a collaborative publication. We will also develop 
insights towards applying best practices based on frameworks and methodologies for human-AI interaction prototyping.

				Workshop participants can submit their own use case to be included in the workshop activities. In this way, participants will have the 
				opportunity to design interactions and get insights from each other for a variety of use cases – including their own. Workshop participants 
				will be actively involved in group activities, including design exercises using card-based and screen-based materials, and round-table discussions 
				and feedback sessions. Attendees will have the chance to present their own use cases and scenarios, and receive feedback, through the group 
				activities and discussions. We expect that such activities will provide us with insights about new ways to prototype interactions between users and 
				models.The use case description should be 1-2 pages (PDF - free format) and include the following: 
Overview: a short description of the situation in which models are to be deployed, and what the goals and reasons for doing so are.
Description of the AI/ML model(s): what model or models form the core of your case study? What are their inputs and outputs, what forms of explanation or interactivity do they provide, and what is important to know about their internal functioning?
Description of the human user(s): what are the various roles present, both directly and indirectly affected by the models?
Scenarios for interactions between user(s) and model(s): what interaction scenarios do you initially have in mind?
Optional: figures/links for model 

Note: workshop participation is not dependent on having an accepted case study – participants will be welcome to join the workshop and work on other examples.

Deadline for submissions use cases: September 25, 2023
Notification date: October 5, 2023 
(these deadlines are slightly later, as participation is not dependent on the submission, and we would like to have a submission date after the CHI deadline, which many potential participants will be working towards)
