                    <h1>Prototyping Human-AI Interactions</h1>
                    This half-day tutorial workshop aims to bring together designers, engineers, and practitioners to explore ways to support the prototyping 
		    of interactions between human users and AI/ML models. Through a combination of paper and screen-based tools, we will present our modeling 
		    approach for designing Human-AI interactions and guide participants in creating their own representations and interactions. The goal of this  
		    workshop is to raise the discussion and get insights towrads bridging the gap between engineering and design practices while designing human-AI 
		    interactions

                </div>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Workshop participants will be actively involved in group activities, including design exercises using card-based and screen-based materials, round-table 
				discussions, and feedback sessions. Participants will follow structured paper-and-card based design exercises that articulate the core concepts through worked examples, 
				and then adapt these to their own case studies. They will also use a screen-based tool that supports model-informed prototyping, to work towards higher fidelity understandings 
				of interactions with models. Finally, we will discuss the challenges towards considering both implementation and design aspects for Responsible AI systems. 
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				The main outcome of the workshop will be the interactions with the participants and the development of understanding of how to model HAI interactions. We will produce 
				a set of example HAI interaction designs based on participant’s case studies that can be brought together as a collaborative publication. We will also develop 
				insights towards applying best practices based on frameworks and methodologies for human-AI interaction prototyping.

                    <h1>Participation - Submit your own Materials</h1>
                </div>
				Workshop participants can submit their own use case to be included in the workshop activities. In this way, participants will have the 
				opportunity to design interactions and get insights from each other for a variety of use cases – including their own. Participants will 
				have the chance to present their own use cases and scenarios, and receive feedback, through the group activities and discussions. We expect 
				that such activities will provide us with insights about new ways to prototype interactions between users and models.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				The use case description should be 1-2 pages in PDF ((<a href="use-case-description.pdf">see example</a>)) and include the following: 
				<ul>
				<li> Overview: a short description of the situation in which models are to be deployed, and what the goals and reasons for doing so are.
				<li> Description of the AI/ML model(s): what model or models form the core of your case study? What are their inputs and outputs, what forms of explanation or interactivity do they provide, and what is important to know about their internal functioning?
				<li> Description of the human user(s): what are the various roles present, both directly and indirectly affected by the models?
				<li> Scenarios for interactions between user(s) and model(s): what interaction scenarios do you initially have in mind?
				<li> Concerns: current implementation and design concerns, e.g., requirements for fairness, transparency, etc. 
				<li> Optional: figures/links for model, data, and interactions 
				</ul>

				<p> Note: workshop participation is not dependent on having an accepted case study – participants will be welcome to join the workshop and work on other examples. </p>

				<p> Deadline for submissions use cases: September 25, 2023 </p>
				<p> Notification date: October 5, 2023 </p>
